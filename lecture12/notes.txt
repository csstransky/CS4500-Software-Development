+ Java has a serialization function for every object
    - Serializes each field at a time, checks versions too
    - Also checks pointers as well, and serializes once for 2 things with 1 pointer
+ We can tell the object to work for us
    - We can have the objects with serialize() functions
+ How do you know that a character array is really a seralized things?
    - Including the class name in the beginning might help
+ When recording data, especially for averages, don't include every significant digit
+ When multithreading, if the number of work (rows) is lower than a certain amount,
then just run the single threaded version
+ New and malloc will cause synchronization because the memory is a pool that the user can draw from
