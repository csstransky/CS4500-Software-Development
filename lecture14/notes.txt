+ We *should* remove names from the DataFrame entirely
+ With global variables, see if you can add optional input arguments to change them
+ When you're quickly using variables in local scope, just do something like:
    char reg_msg[BUFFER_SIZE];
instead of:
    char* reg_msg = new char[BUFFER_SIZE];
    delete[] reg_msg;
+ use strncpy instead of strcpy, because strncpy uses an actual length to copy things
+ doubles quotes gives you a null terminator at the end ("/reg" is really "/reg\0")
+ be careful with strlen because you do have to sometimes add that +1 at the end
+ clients should have the option to kill themselves after a timeout to make sure you don't get 
billed a large amount of money because of a client that isn't dead
+ be careful using String delimiters when you can instead use the length of the String to know where
they end, or edit the String to get rid or change any characters that are delimiters inside of it
+ Sending things in the network happens in a STREAM, so you can sometimes get a chunked up serial
message, which can cause problems
